WUMPUS WORLD

By Shyam Gopal - 011534190

In this program, the agent randomly makes moves to find the gold. If it encounters a stench, it moves back to a previous safe location until it encounters the stench again. If it encounters two stenches, it can find the location of the Wumpus, and shoots accordingly. If the agent locates a stench in the starting position, it shoots randomly and uses the reaction to determine where the Wumpus is, and avoids it for the rest of the game. If the agent detects a breeze in the first position, it climbs out as there is no safe move.
